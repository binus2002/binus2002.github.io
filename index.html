    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Countries in Europe</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
	of the use of arrays and loops. I created a program that dispalys iformation about 
	countries in Europe from a text document, in organised way . Further 
	more i added some interaction with the program, which allows you to display the 
	information in for of a bar chart whisch makes it easier to compare statiscics of countries.
	Last thing i added to my code was to use numbers from withing the text document 
	to represent another statistic(Population density) for each country.
